Geospatial Analysis can aid in planning decisions in the recovery process. In particular, satellite data can be used for land use/ land cover change detection which is useful for analysing the impact of the flood on different areas and selecting suitable sites for emergency response facilities and to inform recovery and rebuilding efforts.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe objectives of the project is therefore to:\n\n-   Investigate the changes in land cover after the flooding of Derna City in Libya on 10 September 2023, due to Storm Daniel and the collapse of the dam.\n\n-   Analyse damage caused by the flood\n\n# Methodology\n\nThe key methodologies of the project include:\n\n-   Data preparation and exploration\n\n    -   Data sourced from\n\n        -   [Maxar's Open Data Program](https://www.maxar.com/open-data/libya-floods-0923)\n\n        -   [COPERNICUS Emergency Management Service - Mapping](https://rapidmapping.emergency.copernicus.eu/EMSR696/download)\n\n        -   [Libya Health Facilities (OpenStreetMap Export) - Humanitarian Data Exchange (humdata.org)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_lby_health_facilities)\n\n-   Land cover classification with statistical and machine learning algorithms\n\n    -   Minimum Distance\n\n    -   Random Forest\n\n-   Land cover change analysis\n\nIn particular, the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) in QGIS will be used for this project, in land cover classification and land cover change analysis.\n\n# Key Findings\n\nIn land cover classification, the Minimum Distance algorithm performed better than Random Forest algorithm.
