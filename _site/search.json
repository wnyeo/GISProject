    "text": "Hello, we are Group 9, welcome to our GIS project website!\nAs part of our project for SMT201: Geographical Information Systems for Urban Planning, our group explored the potential use of GIS and remote sensing technologies in understanding the impact and land use/ land cover change during the 2023 Libya Floods in Derna City.\n\nMotivation of project\nStorm Daniel in the Mediterranean this year (2023) has caused significant damage in Derna, Libya, leading to the collapse of two dams and subsequent flooding and displacement of approximately 40,000 people. Geospatial Analysis can aid in planning decisions in the recovery process. In particular, satellite data can be used for land use/ land cover change detection which is useful for analysing the impact of the flood on different areas and selecting suitable sites for emergency response facilities and to inform recovery and rebuilding efforts.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe objectives of the project is therefore to:\n\nInvestigate the changes in land cover after the flooding of Derna City in Libya on 10 September 2023, due to Storm Daniel and the collapse of the dam.\nAnalyse damage caused by the flood and identify suitable sites for healthcare facilities.\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\nPlease explore this website for more details and findings about this project!"

    "text": "Throughout this project, our team has learnt the importance of documentation when doing projects. Doing up the documentation for analysis and meeting minutes for this project has allowed us to appreciate the importance of documentation in not just allowing for reproducibility, but also helping with troubleshooting. When we are not sure of details with previous analysis, we are able to make use of the documentation to recall and revisit the details. Documentation has also allowed everyone to be clear about the project, ensuring that the team is on the right track.\nThe second learning point was to conduct a cross check or validation with other sources to ensure that we are on the right track. This includes our clarifications with Prof Kam and also with online sources. For this project, we referenced flood trace and flood area data from Copernicus Emergency Management Service - Mapping to better understand what were the areas of flooding.\nThird, contextual research is cruicial before starting on a project. Contextual research on the topic or area has allowed the team to gain a better understanding of what happened and decide on the methodologies. We are also able to better interpret results with contextual understanding.\nLastly, it is important to know the purpose of a type of analysis before starting on it. This can provide more direction and allow the analysis as well as the recommendations to be more targeted. For example, before starting on our analysis, we clarified the use cases of land cover change analysis with Prof. Kam before starting on it. In this case it was to identify which land cover types were affected the most. This helped us decide on what land cover types could represent flood impact (Bare land and Water Body).\nWe would like to thank Prof Kam for this continued guidance for this project."

    "text": "Tropical-like cyclones typically occur once a year in the Mediterranean. This year’s (2023) storm, named Storm Daniel, is the deadliest seen. Derna, a city in Libya was significantly affected by the storm as the Storm resulted in the collapse of two dams, resulting in a flood. The flood washed people out to sea and led to the displacement of around 40,000 people (according to estimates by the UN International Organization of Migration). There were also major impacts infrastructure wise; entire neighbourhoods were swept out to sea, roads were destroyed, and over 3,100 buildings were destroyed (as per estimates by the United Nations satellite centre indicate that around). Floods can also result in long term impacts on the economy as infrastructure and inventory may need a substantial amount of time to be rebuilt. As such, planning is essential to allocate resources effectively so as to maximise recovery and resilience in the future. \nGeospatial Analysis can support planning decisions in the process of recovery to rebuild and strengthen the society against future incidents. Due to the difficulty of accessing on the ground data in areas without established on-the-ground sensing infrastructure, satellite data is the main source of data for post-flood management and planning. Satellite data can be used for land use/ land cover change detection which is useful for analysing the impact of the flood on different areas and selecting suitable sites for emergency response facilities and to inform recovery and rebuilding efforts."

    "text": "Other land cover types to Water body\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Land cover change to Water body\n\n\nObservations: The map above shows that the flooded areas as of 13 September (one day after the flood) are near the mouth of Wadi Derna where the river met the ocean. It shows that the flood had subsided in most areas, though some previously vegetated areas remain inundated. This may be because vegetated areas contained higher amounts of moisture before the flood, making them unable to absorb all the flood water that inundated that area. Other areas, however, were likely drier and thus were able to absorb flood waters."

    "text": "Recommendations for emergency relief facilities\nIn addition, we identified areas that were turned into Bare land and Water body after the flood (damaged areas), non-damaged areas and Derna’s healthcare facilities and major roads for recommendations to locate emergency relief facilities.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Damaged areas after the flood\n\n\nThe healthcare facilities in Derna are outlined in Red in the above map (figure 9). Upon closer inspection, the largest healthcare facility seems to have suffered substantial damage. The northernmost healthcare facility (near the shore) also seems to have suffered significant damage. In light of this damage and the flood, there might need to be temporary healthcare facilities set up. Our group recommends setting up temporary healthcare facilities in non-damaged built-up areas as there may not be enough time and resources to set up new facilities due to the urgency of treating injuries.\nHowever, it must be noted that closer inspection should be done on the ground before selecting this area as temporary healthcare facilities as not all factors determining suitability can be seen from this map.\nOverall, as can be seen by the above map, Derna suffered widespread damage that didn’t spare any area in particular. Due to the damage on road networks, transportation across Derna may be difficult. Therefore, emergency relief facilities such as healthcare facilities and food banks should aim to be distributed across the city and make use of existing built-up areas before evacuation and/or rebuilding efforts are in place."
