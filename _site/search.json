    "text": "Tropical-like cyclones typically occur once a year in the Mediterranean. This year’s (2023) storm, named Storm Daniel, is the deadliest seen. Derna, a city in Libya was significantly affected by the storm as the Storm resulted in the collapse of two dams, resulting in a flood. The flood washed people out to sea and led to the displacement of around 40,000 people (according to estimates by the UN International Organization of Migration). There were also major impacts infrastructure wise; entire neighbourhoods were swept out to sea, roads were destroyed, and over 3,100 buildings were destroyed (as per estimates by United Nations satellite centre indicate that around)\nDue to the difficulty of accessing on the ground data in areas without established on-the-ground sensing infrastructure, satellite data is the main source of data for post-flood management and planning. Satellite data can be used for land use/ land cover change detection which is useful for analysing the impact of the flood on different areas and better planning cities to be more disaster resistant in the future."
