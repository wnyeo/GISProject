# Land cover classification

The classification of pre flood land cover is as follows:

The classification of post flood land cover is as follows:

After the classification of land use pre and post flood, a land cover change analysis is conducted. We focused on land cover change into bare land and water body to observed the extent of damage and flooding done.

# Change in land cover classification

## Other land cover types to Bare Land

Observations: The map above shows that for the land in closer proximity to the dam, there are generally more changes from other land types to bare land. It also appears that there was more damage to Built-up areas to the East of Wadi Derna, indicating that the East part of Derna may be more prone to flood damage.

## Other land cover types to Water body

Observations: The map above shows that the flooded areas as of 13 September (one day after the flood) are near the mouth of Wadi Derna where the river met the ocean. It shows that the flood had subsided in most areas, though some previously vegetated areas remain inundated. This may be because vegetated areas contained higher amounts of moisture before the flood, making them unable to absorb all the flood water that inundated that area. Other areas, however, were likely drier and thus were able to absorb flood waters.

# Recommendations

Given the observations above, we would like to provide the following recommendations to avoid disastrous impact of floods in the future:

-   Avoid building settlements and buildings near the Wadi Derna and areas that were heavily impacted by this flood (flooded areas and areas with flood trace)

-   Rebuild the dams using an asphalt-concrete core

-   Build flood walls along Wadi Derna
