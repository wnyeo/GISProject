The project will use supervised classification to identify change in land use/ land cover in Derna City pre and post floods. For satellite images for **both pre and post floods satellite data**, the following steps will be used:

## Section 1: Selection of classes for training and testing

1.1: The following classes are chosen for the analysis:

-   Built-up area

-   Bare land

-   Impervious surfaces

-   Water body

-   Vegetation

-   Cloud

-   Cloud shadow

## Section 2: Training

2.1: Select areas and add training samples for each land cover type

2.2: Check ROI signature

2.3: Run SCP Classification on 2 Algorithms: Minimum Distance and Maximum Likelihood

2.4: Run Random forest classification with DzetsakaÂ 

## Section 3: Testing

3.1: Add testing samples for each land cover type

3.2: Calculate accuracy for the different algorithms using the same test samples in section 3.2 with SCP plugin

## Section 4: Evaluation

4.1: Evaluation of different classification model

4.2: Select the better model for subsequent analysis

## Section 5: Analysis

5.1: Change detection of classes with SCP Plugin

5.2: Analyse extent of flood damage
