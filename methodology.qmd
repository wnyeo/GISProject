The project will use supervised classification to identify change in land cover in Derna City pre and post floods. This page outlines the main steps and methodology for analysis, more a more detailed guide, please find it in our project report: [link](https://smt201-group9-libya-flood-mapping.netlify.app/report "Step-by-step guide")

## Section 1: Downloading the required data

The data required for the analysis are as follows:

1.  Data for pre and post floods from [Maxar's Open Data Program](https://www.maxar.com/open-data/libya-floods-0923)
2.  250m Study Area Hexagon of Derna city

Download the datasets for analysis.

## Section 2: Data preparation

2.1: Preparing and save the 250m Study Area Hexagon of Derna City to the GeoPackage

2.2: Merge and Clip pre and post flood satellite imagery for Derna City

## Section 3: Data Exploration: creating False Color Composite images

Create False Color Composite (FCC) for both pre and post flood layers.

FCC for post flood layer:![False Color Composite of Post flood layer](img/FCC_postflood.png)

## Section 4: Training the supervised classification model

4.1: Choosing the classes for analysis

The following classes are chosen for the analysis:

-   Built-up area

-   Bare land

-   Impervious surfaces

-   Water body

-   Vegetation

-   Cloud \[Only for post flood layer\]

-   Cloud shadow \[Only for post flood layer\]

4.2: Select areas and add training samples for each land cover type

4.3: Check ROI signature

4.4: Run SCP Classification on 2 Algorithms: Minimum Distance and Random Forest

## Section 5: Evaluating the classification

5.1: Add testing samples for each land cover type

5.2: Calculate accuracy for the different algorithms (Minimum Distance and Random Forest) using the same test samples in section 5.1 with SCP plugin.

**Repeat Section 4 - 5 for the post flood layer**

## Section 6: Change Analysis

6.1: Evaluate better algorithm and use the corresponding land classification layer for change detection

6.2: Change detection of classes with SCP Plugin

6.2: Analyse extent of flood damage

## Section 7: Cross checking with external sources

7.1: Downloading the data

7.2: Clip data to study area

7.3: Style the data

## Section 8: Identifying suitable sites for a temporary healthcare facility based on land use change
